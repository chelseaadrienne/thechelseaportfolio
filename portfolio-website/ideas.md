# Portfolio Website Design Brainstorming

**Design Movement**: Y2K Revival meets Neo-Brutalism

**Core Principles**:
- Bold, unapologetic use of Barbie pink as the dominant color with high contrast black typography
- Geometric shapes and asymmetric layouts that break traditional grid conventions
- Playful yet functional interactions that feel tactile and immediate
- Raw, honest presentation of work without excessive polish or smoothing

**Color Philosophy**: 
Embrace the maximalist energy of early 2000s web design with a modern twist. Barbie pink (#FF69B4) serves as the primary brand color, creating instant visual impact and memorable personality. Black text ensures maximum readability while white and light grey provide breathing room. The palette is intentionally limited to create bold, graphic compositions rather than soft gradients.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Asymmetric grid-breaking layouts with intentional "collisions" between sections. Hero section uses diagonal cuts and overlapping elements. Project cards are staggered in a masonry-style layout with varying sizes. Skills matrix uses a bento-box inspired grid with different sized cells.

**Signature Elements**:
- Thick, chunky borders (4-8px) in black around cards and sections
- Diagonal section dividers using CSS clip-path for dynamic transitions
- Oversized, bold typography for headings with tight letter-spacing
- Pill-shaped buttons and badges with solid fills

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Interactions should feel immediate and physical. Hover states use bold transforms (scale, skew) rather than subtle opacity changes. Buttons have a "press" effect. Links underline aggressively. Scrolling reveals content with snap-in animations.

**Animation**:
Fast, snappy animations (150-250ms) with ease-out curves. Elements slide in from angles rather than fading. Hover effects use scale(1.05) and slight rotation. Page transitions feel like flipping through a magazine.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Space Grotesk (700-800 weight) for headings - geometric, modern, bold
- Body: DM Sans (400-500 weight) for readable content - clean, neutral
- Code/Tech: JetBrains Mono for technical details
- Hierarchy: Extreme size contrast (h1 at 4rem, body at 1rem)

**Design Movement**: Soft Modernism with Kawaii Influences

**Core Principles**:
- Gentle, rounded aesthetics with generous padding and soft shadows
- Barbie pink used as accent color with white as primary background
- Delicate, floating layouts that feel light and airy
- Subtle animations that add personality without overwhelming

**Color Philosophy**:
Create a dreamy, approachable atmosphere using Barbie pink (#FFB6D9) as a softer, lighter accent rather than a dominant force. White backgrounds keep the design clean and professional while light grey (#F5F5F5) provides subtle depth. Black text is softened slightly to charcoal (#2D2D2D) for a gentler reading experience. The palette evokes femininity without sacrificing professionalism.

**Layout Paradigm**:
Floating card-based design with generous margins and breathing room. Content is centered but with offset elements that create visual interest. Sections flow vertically with ample whitespace between them. Project cards float with soft shadows, creating a layered, dimensional feel.

**Signature Elements**:
- Rounded corners (24-32px border-radius) on all cards and buttons
- Soft, multi-layered shadows (0 8px 32px rgba(255, 105, 180, 0.15))
- Small decorative elements (stars, hearts, sparkles) as SVG accents
- Gradient overlays on images (pink to transparent)

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Interactions should feel gentle and delightful. Hover states lift elements with increased shadow depth. Buttons glow softly on hover. Micro-interactions include subtle bounce effects and floating animations. Everything feels responsive but never jarring.

**Animation**:
Smooth, flowing animations (300-500ms) with ease-in-out curves. Elements fade and float into view. Hover effects use translateY(-4px) with shadow depth changes. Loading states use gentle pulse animations. Scroll-triggered animations reveal content with soft upward motion.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Outfit (600-700 weight) for headings - rounded, friendly, modern
- Body: Inter (400-500 weight) for content - highly readable, professional
- Accent: Pacifico for decorative elements and personal touches
- Hierarchy: Moderate contrast (h1 at 3rem, body at 1rem) with generous line-height (1.6)

**Design Movement**: Swiss Design meets Vaporwave

**Core Principles**:
- Strict grid system with mathematical precision and intentional rule-breaking moments
- Barbie pink used strategically as highlight color against stark black and white
- High contrast, maximum legibility with clear visual hierarchy
- Retro-futuristic elements that nod to 80s/90s computer aesthetics

**Color Philosophy**:
Embrace the tension between minimalism and maximalism. Start with a Swiss-inspired black and white foundation, then inject Barbie pink (#FF1493) as an electric accent that demands attention. Light grey (#E8E8E8) creates subtle zones and backgrounds. The limited palette creates dramatic focal points - when pink appears, it's intentional and powerful.

**Layout Paradigm**:
Strict 12-column grid system with precise alignment, but sections break the grid intentionally for emphasis. Hero section uses a split-screen layout (60/40). Projects display in a strict 3-column grid. Skills matrix uses a data-table inspired layout with alternating row colors. Blog section breaks into a two-column editorial layout.

**Signature Elements**:
- Thin, precise lines (1px) used as dividers and grid markers
- Monospace typography for technical details and labels
- Glitch effects on hover for headings and key elements
- Gradient mesh backgrounds in pink that shift on scroll
- Terminal-inspired code blocks and technical sections

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Interactions should feel precise and intentional. Hover states reveal hidden information or shift colors from black to pink. Buttons have sharp, immediate state changes. Navigation is clear and functional. The interface feels like a well-designed tool.

**Animation**:
Crisp, precise animations (200-300ms) with linear or ease-in-out-cubic curves. Elements snap into place rather than float. Glitch effects use rapid position shifts. Scroll animations reveal content with horizontal wipes. Color transitions are instant or use step functions for digital feel.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Archivo Black (900 weight) for headings - condensed, powerful, architectural
- Body: IBM Plex Sans (400-500 weight) for content - technical, readable, neutral
- Mono: IBM Plex Mono for code, labels, and technical details
- Hierarchy: Strong contrast (h1 at 5rem, body at 1rem) with tight line-height (1.2 for headings)
